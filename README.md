## Assignment 1: BFS/DFS/IDDFS Grid-World Path-Finding

### Description:

For this assignment, I dived into the fundamentals of pathfinding algorithms, specifically Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS). It was quite exciting to implement these algorithms in the context of grid-world pathfinding scenarios. My task was to find optimal paths from a start point to a goal point in various grid configurations, and let me tell you, testing the efficiency and effectiveness of each algorithm was quite enlightening!

### Instructions:

- Implemented BFS, DFS, and IDDFS algorithms for grid-world pathfinding.
- Tested the algorithms on different grid configurations and analyzed their performance.

For detailed instructions and setup guidelines, you can check out the [Assignment 1 README](assignment-1/README.md).

## Assignment 2: A* Pathfinding

### Description:

This assignment delved into the A* pathfinding algorithm, a widely-used method for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. I had the opportunity to implement the A* algorithm with support for both unidirectional and bidirectional search modes. Additionally, incorporating multiple heuristic options such as 8-directional Manhattan, 4-directional Manhattan, and 2D Euclidean distance truly enhanced the pathfinding accuracy and efficiency.

### Instructions:

- Implemented the A* pathfinding algorithm with unidirectional and bidirectional search modes.
- Integrated various heuristic options to evaluate path costs and guide the search process.
- Conducted thorough testing and performance analysis to assess the algorithm's effectiveness in different scenarios.

For comprehensive instructions and setup details, refer to the [Assignment 2 README](assignment-2/README.md).
